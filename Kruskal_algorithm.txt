*************************   Kruskal’s algorithm   ***********************

Kruskal’s algorithm is used to obtain minimum spanning tree and is one of the greedy algorithm

 Kruskal’s algorithm sorts all the edges in increasing order of their edge weights and keeps adding nodes to the tree only if the chosen edge does not form any cycle.
 Also, it picks the edge with a minimum cost at first and the edge with a maximum cost at last.
 Hence, you can say that the Kruskal algorithm makes a locally optimal choice, intending to find the global optimal solution.
 That is why it is called a Greedy Algorithm.

 Kruskal’s Algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree:

Step 1: Sort all edges in increasing order of their edge weights.
Step 2: Pick the smallest edge.
Step 3: Check if the new edge creates a cycle or loop in a spanning tree.
Step 4: If it doesn’t form the cycle, then include that edge in MST. Otherwise, discard it.
Step 5: Repeat from step 2 until it includes |V| - 1 edges in MST.


Using the steps mentioned above, you will generate a minimum spanning tree structure.
